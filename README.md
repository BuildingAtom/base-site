# base-site

This is the basic site template I'm using to create my personal site. It is still very much under development and far from complete relative to the designs I have planned out for it, but it's getting there.

I was looking to create a relatively simplistic (at least in appearance) site that put the majority of the focus on the what while still providing the other necessities.

## Installation

Start with getting the dependencies for Jekyll, then clone or fork the repository to get the base files, and get project dependencies by executing:

    $ bundle

Then launch with:

    $ jekyll serve
