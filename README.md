# base-site

This is the basic site template I'm using to create my personal site. It is still very much under development and far from complete relative to the designs I have planned out for it, but it's getting there.

I was looking to create a relatively simplistic (at least in appearance) site that put the majority of the focus on the what while still providing the other necessities. It includes Bootstrap icons, so you can add any icon from https://icons.getbootstrap.com/.

Setup CI by adding PUBLISH_TOKEN to the repo secrets storing a Personal access token to it (but only do this after verifying the github workflow file!

## Installation

Start with getting the dependencies for Jekyll, then clone or fork the repository to get the base files, and get project dependencies by executing:
